N Queens Problem: “This is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no queens threaten each other;
Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.”

In the project, which consists of several stages, first of all, the number of attacks, which is the problem of this problem, was determined. 
In other phases of the project, "Breath-First, Uniform-Cost, Depth-First, Limited-Depth-First, Iterative-Depth-First, A*, Greedy, Hill-Climbing Search,
  Random-Restart Hill-Climbing Search, Genetic Search" by using AI search algorithms, this number of attacks was reset and the speed measurements and 
  result comparisons of the algorithms were made. It was implemented with Python and the SimpleAI library was used.
